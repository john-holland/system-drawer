// combining the system we outlined in hand.cs using the ragdoll animation body we built in locomotion/musculature
// let's build a system that allows you to run ragdoll animations that are partially or wholely merge-able with
// procedural animations
//  additionally, the procedural animations should use a set of "good sections" developing a deck of animation cards
//     that allow the ragdoll to animate partially, or entirely
