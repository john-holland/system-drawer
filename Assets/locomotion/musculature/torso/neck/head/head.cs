// the head has a bunch of plates that are one piece
//  and a jaw that flaps around
// the head also has a bunch of muscle on top for articulating the face and some hair expressions
// the nose has a piece of cartilage supporting it
//  we have the eyebrows  representing each with planes or cloth, like a curtain sinched at two corners, and
//    with two delicate groups of muscles wrapped like a venetian (van-ee-shan (sp?)) blind
//    while a delicate job, the muscles extend up into the skull under the hair and above the bone
// the nose is conncted to the eye muscles and the cheek muscles, individually articulateable with assist from cheeks or brows
// the cheeks are connected to muscle that extends up the side of the head but doesn't go back much
//    and along the jaw are muscles to help animate the cheeks and lips
//    primarily: chin muscle (lower lip up down),
//               jaw muscle (frown / dimple smile), 
//               cheek muscle (smile, grimace), 
//               nose muscle (scrunchy smile, eye squeezies)
// the ears are connected slightly through skin but not sinew to the muscles on top of head
//   the ears can be articulated by pulling the muscles that scrunch the forhead, and in the prosterior of the head
//      there may be specific ear muscles also used by the brow, evolved to pull the earway clear temporarily of wax (just a guess)

// the head should have a number of expressions and a set of topologies that reach that expression
// the head should have mouth limits
// additionally the head should have a number of degrees to open the mouth
