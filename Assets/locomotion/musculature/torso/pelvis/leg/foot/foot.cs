// the foot is a lot like the hand
//   in fact, we should consider building the foot using the same tenants as the hand
// except:
//  the foot pinky has a prehensile digit that can't be moved, so it's like the foot has two thumbs!
//  like on the hand the pinky is attached has its own muscle, but on the foot, the other toes are slightly more
//     connected
//  the big toe is not a thumb, and has more limited aposeability
