// the knee is a powerful artiulated joint and is like a protected elbow
// the lower leg has two bones that turn to turn the foot, where the upper leg has a large crutch to catch the lower legs
//   and at the top, a large ball joint like the shoulder, with similar limits although a steeper eliptoid limit on most adults
// the knee can bend anywhere between zero, and 180 to 270
// the knee has a fluid packet between the patella (knee bone), that is pressed against to protect the lower leg bones from grinding
// against the upper leg bone
//  this fluid packet and the sinew allow the knee to sort of "float" the weight, like one of those floating corded tables
//
// the top leg front muscles (name?) pull the patella up
// the top leg back muscles (name?) pull the patella taught
// the bottom leg muscles are mostly connected to the bottom leg bones, but have some small anchors in the patella and knee region
// sinew passes through the leg under patella and fluid packet, while the pattella is pulled like a second person pushing your legs
