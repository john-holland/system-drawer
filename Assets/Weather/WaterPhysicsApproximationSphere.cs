// a boyds-with-boyancy approximation for water physics and flow!
// a pooled collection of sphere's that flow and hit, in a shader memory collection accessible field
// should include ideas around lod, so view frustrum scale, included texture coords for rushing water

// cheap boyancy! vector A water sphere, vector B boat: ||B - A|| * Vector3.Up + B
