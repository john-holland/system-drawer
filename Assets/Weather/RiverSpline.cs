// a river spline is a path you'd like the water to follow
// head and tail, flow will be physically estimated procedural animation with physics side effects (invisible balls in space flowing etc for prebaking)
// since we will be estimating river and pond creation, and flow 
// properties for a few water modes:
// wave, spray, rush, white water rush, still, still but moving under, ripling
// and should use a spline painting math technique to fit the shader for a given stretch of river bend vertex
// we'll have to work coords or something and expose these to the shader lib cheaply to make these fun and worry free
// should look like hairy fiery watery dithered flowing rivers of water!

// specific wind effects
